Hey{% if user_name %} {{ user_name }}{% endif %}! ðŸ‘‹

I'm thrilled you've decided to meet with me! I'm Andy, your personal life coach, and I'm here to support you on your journey.

Let me tell you a bit about how I can help:

- You can share updates about your health, food, workouts, sleep, and more.
- Feel free to send me pictures - I'll save them securely on your Google Drive.
- And if you just want to chat, that's perfectly fine too! 

My goal is to help you reach your goals, whatever they may be. Whether you need guidance, motivation, or just a friendly ear, I'm here for you.

Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions along the way. I'm excited to get started and see what we can achieve together!

Ready to begin your journey to a better you?
